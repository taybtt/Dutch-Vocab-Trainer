# Dutch-Vocab-Trainer

Functions:
- A word adding section:
    where you can past words and their meanings and it will check whether the word you wanted to add is already in the dictionary.
    
    - You should be able to do this by putting multiple words at the same time. A new line means a new word.

    - It would be great to either train an AI or to manually ask the user to input the type of the words inputted (verb, adj, noun, etc) or maybe even have different sections such as words, expressions, phrases, etc. This will later be usefull when the training starts

- A word trainer:
    where you can study the words you have inputted, it should have a ratio of new words introduced while showing you words you have seen before but not yet mastered.

    - A word should have multiple mastery levels:
        - New Word
        - Seen before
        - Learning
        - Mastered
    
    - Once a word is mastered it should be showed less often to open up time to learn more words.

    - When it shows a user a multiple choice question, the wrong choices should also be from the same word type. Example: A noun should only show other nouns as a possible answer for multiple choice questions since it is very easy to understand the word type and that reduces the number of possibly correct answers which in turn reduces the engagement of the user.
